# Smart Policing using AI and Facial Recognition System (FRS)

## Overview : 

####   -->  Our Smart Policing solution leverages the power of CCTV cameras and computer vision technology to enhance public safety and security. The system uses a network of CCTV cameras to monitor public spaces. Each camera stream is processed by our computer vision algorithms, enabling real-time identification and validation of individuals with criminal history. This robust system provides a range of features to ensure a safer community.
