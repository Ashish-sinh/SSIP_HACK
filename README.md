## Introduction

Our Smart Policing solution leverages the power of CCTV cameras and computer vision technology to enhance public safety and security. The system uses a network of CCTV cameras to monitor public spaces. Each camera stream is processed by our computer vision algorithms, enabling real-time identification and validation of individuals with criminal history. This robust system provides a range of features to ensure a safer community.

🔍 **Real-Time Validation of Individuals with Criminal History**:
- We have developed a cutting-edge system that integrates Facial Recognition System (FRS) for instant identification and validation of individuals with criminal records, enabling law enforcement to act swiftly and decisively.
